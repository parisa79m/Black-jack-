 Blackjack is a casino banked game, meaning that players compete against the house rather than each other.
 The objective is to get a hand total of closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21 (busting). At the start of a Blackjack game,
 the players and the dealer receive two cards each.
 Before cards are dealt, player places his bet. player starts with two cards that are face up. Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11.
 One of dealer's cards is face down(hidden card).
 Hit means that player wants another card, and STAY means that player won't get another card and dealer should play.
 If dealer's score is less than 17, he will get another card until the score goes over 17.
